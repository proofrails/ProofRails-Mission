# ProofRails-Mission

ProofRails exists to make every blockchain transaction verifiable, compliant-ready, and trusted — by anyone, anywhere.

We build the open standard for Payment Proofs: a common language that connects decentralized payments with the financial systems and regulations of the real world.

Our mission is to turn crypto transactions into reliable, audit-ready records — creating the infrastructure layer that allows stablecoins, wallets, and fintechs to operate with transparency, accountability, and global interoperability.

We believe verification should always be open, and the systems that guarantee it must remain secure and reliable. That’s why ProofRails combines open-source standards and verifier tools with a trusted core service that guarantees integrity, uptime, and compliance.

We empower builders, auditors, and institutions to collaborate — extending ProofRails through open SDKs, public specs, and verifiable records — while safeguarding the reliability and neutrality of the infrastructure that anchors global payments.
